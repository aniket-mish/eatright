# Daily ðŸ•¸ Bugle

I'm building a news aggregator app but for superhero fans. This app keeps track of all the superhero stuff going on in the world (movies, tv shows). You can talk to it and ask all things including eastereggs.

## Dataset

Let's create a synthetic instruction-following dataset 
[Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html)

## Data extraction

Once the data is scraped, I'm cleaning and storing it in a nosql database. I have a change data capture pattern implemented that checks any change made in the database.
